# üó∫Ô∏è Mapty ‚Äì Track Your Workouts on a Map
---

## **Project Overview**
Mapty is an interactive web application that allows users to **log their running and cycling workouts directly on a map**. Using the browser's **Geolocation API** and **Leaflet.js**, users can add workouts with details like distance, duration, cadence, or elevation gain. Each workout is displayed on the map as a marker, and in a sidebar list with all details.

The app also supports **editing workouts, deleting single or all workouts, and sorting them by distance**. Data is stored in the browser using **localStorage**, so it persists even after refreshing the page.
